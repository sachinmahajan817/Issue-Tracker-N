## Development Plan

The data is stored in a document database (MongoDB). GraphQL relationships and SQL table joins were not needed, therefore prioritizing developer experience was paramount and for that reason MongoDB was chosen. 

Issue documents have subdocuments called comments. Anyone can attach a subdocument to anyone else's issue. Issue documents also have special 'enums' called tags. These are a limited set of strings that catagorize issues. These are used to create the Kanban board view on the front end. 

Only owners of issues and comments can edit or delete their respective creations.
